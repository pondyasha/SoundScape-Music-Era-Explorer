# SoundScape-Music-Era-Explorer
Music Era Explorer. This project aims to create an interactive platform where users can explore and discover music based on different time periods or decades.

1. **Data Collection**: Use the Spotify API to gather data on tracks, their release dates, and associated audio features, such as danceability, energy, tempo, and valence. Collect data across various genres and time periods to provide a diverse range of music.
2. **Time-based Categorization**: Group the tracks by their release dates into time periods or decades (e.g., 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, etc.). For each time period, calculate the average or median values of the audio features to understand the general musical characteristics of that era.
3. **Interactive Visualization**: Create an interactive web application or dashboard that allows users to choose a specific time period or decade. Display the top tracks, artists, or albums from the selected era, along with the average or median audio features, to provide insights into the musical trends of that time. Users can explore and listen to these tracks, artists, or albums directly on the platform.
    1. Analyze trends in music consumption over time, such as genre popularity, audio feature distributions, or regional preferences. Use time-series data and visualizations to display how these trends have evolved. Create an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore different time periods, genres, or regions, and gain insights into the dynamics of the music industry.
4. **User Experience**: Enhance the user experience by allowing users to input their favorite tracks or artists. The system then recommends tracks, artists, or albums from different time periods that share similar audio features or genres.
